# RPC Speed Test

This tool allows users to compare the speed of a number of popular custom RPCs on Ethereum. 

The user can select (or even input) the RPCs they wish to compare, customize the number of transactions used for the comparison, and even the delay time between each loop.

The RPC Speed Test operates on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Avalanche mainnets, and Polygon Mumbai testnet. Access it [here](https://speedtest.edennetwork.io).


# Getting Started

If you want to run this test locally, you can do it by running `yarn dev` in your terminal, and then open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Once the RPC Speed Test web page has loaded, changes made to files inside the src/ directory (e.g. src/pages/index.tsx) will automatically update the webpage.
